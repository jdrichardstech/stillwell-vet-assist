<!-- We answer commonly asked questions about coronavirus (COVID-19) and smoking.

People who smoke are generally at higher risk of respiratory tract infections, like lung and chest infections, but there is currently not enough evidence to be certain that people who smoke are at higher risk of being infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19). However, people with poor lung function (as a result of smoking or anything else) may be at higher risk of complications if they do become infected with the virus. It’s not clear how long a person needs to stop smoking to reduce their risk of these complications. It’s important to remember stopping smoking has many benefits beyond any link with COVID-19, so it’s always a good time to quit.
Q. Are people who smoke at more risk of getting COVID-19?
While there isn’t enough evidence to be certain that people who smoke are more likely to be infected by COVID-19, we know that they are at a higher risk of getting lung and chest infections in general. This means that it’s more likely than not that people who smoke have a higher risk of getting COVID-19 compared to people who don’t smoke. 

Q. Are people who smoke more likely to have severe complications if they do become infected with COVID-19?
There is growing evidence to suggest that people who smoke are likely to be more severely impacted by COVID-19 if they do become infected, because smoking damages the lungs so that they don’t work as well. For example, lungs naturally produce mucus, but people who smoke have more and thicker mucus that is hard to clean out of the lungs. This mucus clogs the lungs and is prone to becoming infected. Smoking also affects the immune system, making it harder to fight infection.

Q. What if I previously smoked? Am I still at more risk of being infected with COVID-19?
It’s not currently known if former smokers have a higher risk of becoming infected compared to people who have never smoked. People who smoke are at increased risk of lung infections in general, but the lungs do heal relatively rapidly when people stop smoking. It’s not yet known how long is long enough to reduce the risk to the same as someone who has never smoked. 

If you previously smoked and are now quit, it’s likely you’ll have a lower risk of severe complications (if you were infected) than you would have if you were still smoking.

Q. For how long do people have to stop smoking to reduce their risk of infection with COVID-19 or complications from COVID-19?
This is not currently known for COVID-19 specifically, but it’s well-established that stopping smoking improves lung function within a few months. Rates of lung infections like bronchitis and pneumonia also decrease.

Q. Where can I get the best support to stop smoking?
The best thing you can do for your health is to stop smoking. The best way to stop smoking is to use a tailored quit counselling service such as Quitline 13 7848, plus nicotine replacement therapy, for instance nicotine patches and gum. Quitline counsellors are available Mon – Friday 8am – 8pm and provide personalised, non-judgemental and empathetic support to help you quit, including information on the types of nicotine replacement therapy available. 

Quitline is an inclusive and culturally safe space for all, including the LGBTIQA+ community.
